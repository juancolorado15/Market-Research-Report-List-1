<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acid Dyes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Strong Acid Dyes</li><li>Weak Acid Dyes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acid dyes are a type of dye specifically designed for use on protein-based fibers such as wool, silk, and nylon. There are two main types of acid dyes: strong acid dyes and weak acid dyes. Strong acid dyes are highly soluble in water and typically require the use of a mordant to set the dye, resulting in vibrant and long-lasting colors. Weak acid dyes, on the other hand, are less soluble and often do not require a mordant, resulting in softer and more subtle shades. Both types are widely used in the textile industry for coloring fabrics and yarns.</p></p>
