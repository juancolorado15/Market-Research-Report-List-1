<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Robotic Vacuums Filter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Washable Type</li><li>Non-washable Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Robotic vacuum filters come in two main types: washable and non-washable. Washable filters are designed to be reusable and can be cleaned by rinsing with water, making them more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. On the other hand, non-washable filters are disposable and need to be replaced regularly, adding to the ongoing cost of owning a robotic vacuum. Both types serve the same purpose of trapping dust and debris to improve air quality and maintain the efficiency of the vacuum.</p></p>
