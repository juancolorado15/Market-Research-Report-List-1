<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Concrete Dams Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roller Compacted Concrete Dam</li><li>Normal Concrete Dam</li><li>Prefabricated Concrete Dam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The concrete dams market is categorized into three types - Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) Dam, Normal Concrete Dam, and Prefabricated Concrete Dam. RCC dams are constructed using a dry mix of cement and aggregates, rolled and compacted to form a solid structure. Normal concrete dams are built by pouring liquid concrete into formwork on-site, allowing it to harden and form a strong barrier. Prefabricated concrete dams are manufactured in sections off-site and then transported and assembled at the dam site. These different types of concrete dams offer various advantages depending on the specific project requirements.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Concrete Dams Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Dam</li><li>Massive Head Buttress Dam</li><li>Arch Dam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Concrete dams are widely used in water resource development projects. Gravity dams are large and heavy structures that rely on their own weight to resist the water pressure. Massive head buttress dams feature reinforced concrete buttresses that support the dam against the water forces. Arch dams are built in curved shapes that transfer the water pressure to the abutments on the sides. Each type has its advantages and is chosen based on geographical conditions and project requirements, ensuring the safe storage and controlled release of water.</p></p>
