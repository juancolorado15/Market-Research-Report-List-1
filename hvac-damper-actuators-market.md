<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The HVAC Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>HVAC damper actuators are essential components in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. They control the airflow in HVAC systems by opening and closing dampers. There are two main types of HVAC damper actuators: spring return and non-spring return. Spring return damper actuators use a spring to automatically return the damper to a default position when power is removed, while non-spring return damper actuators require power to both open and close the damper. Each type has its own advantages and applications in HVAC systems.</p></p>
