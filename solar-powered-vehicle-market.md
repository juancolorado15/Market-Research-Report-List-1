<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Powered Vehicle Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)</li><li>Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar powered vehicles are classified into two main market types: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). BEVs are fully electric vehicles that run on electricity stored in their batteries, which are charged by solar panels. On the other hand, HEVs combine a traditional combustion engine with an electric motor and battery, allowing the vehicle to switch between the two power sources. Both types of vehicles utilize solar power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and decrease carbon emissions.</p></p>
