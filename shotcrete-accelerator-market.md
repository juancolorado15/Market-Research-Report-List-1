<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shotcrete Accelerator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Accelerator</li><li>Powdered Accelerator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shotcrete accelerator is an additive used in construction to accelerate the setting and hardening process of shotcrete, which is a concrete mixture sprayed onto surfaces. There are two main types of shotcrete accelerators: liquid accelerator and powdered accelerator. Liquid accelerators are in liquid form and are typically added to the mixing water before spraying, while powdered accelerators are dry powders that are added directly to the shotcrete mixture. Both types serve the same purpose of speeding up the shotcrete application process.</p></p>
