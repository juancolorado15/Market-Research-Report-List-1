<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Exhaust Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Exhaust Pipe Exhaust Brake</li><li>Engine Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Exhaust Brake refers to a device that helps in slowing down a vehicle by restricting the flow of exhaust gases. There are two main types of Exhaust Brakes: Exhaust Pipe Exhaust Brake and Engine Exhaust Brake. Exhaust Pipe Exhaust Brake operates by restricting the flow of exhaust gases through the exhaust pipe, while Engine Exhaust Brake works by modifying the engine's operation to create backpressure in the exhaust system. Both types of Exhaust Brakes are commonly used in heavy-duty vehicles to improve overall braking performance and reduce wear on traditional braking systems.</p></p>
