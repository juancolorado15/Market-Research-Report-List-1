<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IV Bags Polypropylene Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PP-H</li><li>PP-R</li></ul></p>
<p><p>IV bags made of polypropylene can be classified into two main types: PP-H and PP-R. PP-H, or polypropylene homopolymer, is a type of polypropylene that is more rigid and has higher heat resistance, making it suitable for applications requiring high stiffness and temperature resistance. On the other hand, PP-R, or polypropylene random copolymer, is a more flexible type of polypropylene that offers better impact resistance and thermal stability. Both types of polypropylene are commonly used in the manufacturing of IV bags due to their chemical resistance and durability.</p></p>
