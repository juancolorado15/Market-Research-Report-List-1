<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retarder(Mechanical Engineering) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electric Retarders</li><li>Hydraulic Retarders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retarders in mechanical engineering are used to slow down vehicles, particularly heavy-duty trucks and buses, to prevent wear and tear on the brakes. The two main types of retarders are electric retarders, which use an electric motor to generate braking force, and hydraulic retarders, which use hydraulic fluid to create resistance. Electric retarders are known for their efficiency and quiet operation, while hydraulic retarders are preferred for their high braking torque and reliability in extreme conditions. Both types offer unique benefits depending on the application.</p></p>
