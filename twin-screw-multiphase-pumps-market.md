<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Twin Screw Multiphase Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Twin-screw Pump (TSP)</li><li>Helicoaxial Pump (HAP)</li><li>Progressing-cavity Pump (PCP)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Twin Screw Multiphase Pumps are divided into three main types: Twin-screw Pump (TSP), Helicoaxial Pump (HAP), and Progressing-cavity Pump (PCP). Twin-screw Pump uses two intermeshing screws to move the fluid, providing high efficiency and reliability. Helicoaxial Pump utilizes a helical rotor to transfer multiphase fluids with low gas volume fraction. Progressing-cavity Pump features a helical rotor rotating inside a stator, suitable for pumping highly viscous fluids and multiphase mixtures. Each type offers unique advantages for different applications in the market.</p></p>
