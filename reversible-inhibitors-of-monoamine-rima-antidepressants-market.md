<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reversible Inhibitors of Monoamine (RIMA) Antidepressants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nonselective MAO-Ainhibitors</li><li>Selective MAO-B inhibitors</li><li>Nonselective MAO-B inhibitors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Reversible Inhibitors of Monoamine (RIMA) Antidepressants are a type of medication that work by blocking the enzymes called monoamine oxidases (MAOs). There are three main types of RIMA antidepressants based on their selectivity: Nonselective MAO-A inhibitors, which block both MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes; Selective MAO-B inhibitors, which specifically target the MAO-B enzyme; and Nonselective MAO-B inhibitors, which block both MAO-A and MAO-B enzymes but with a greater effect on MAO-B. These different types of inhibitors offer various benefits and risks for treating depression and other mental health conditions.</p></p>
