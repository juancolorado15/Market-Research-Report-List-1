<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Methylmethacrylate (MMA) Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermosetting Adhesives</li><li>Thermoplasticity Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Methylmethacrylate (MMA) adhesives are commonly classified into two types based on their curing mechanisms: thermosetting adhesives and thermoplasticity adhesives. Thermosetting adhesives, once cured, cannot be re-melted or softened with heat, making them ideal for applications requiring high temperature resistance. Thermoplasticity adhesives, on the other hand, can be re-melted and reformed after curing, allowing for ease of rework and repair. Both types of MMA adhesives offer unique properties and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</p></p>
