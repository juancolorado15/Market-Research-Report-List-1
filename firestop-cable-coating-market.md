<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Firestop Cable Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IntumescentCableCoatings</li><li>Non-IntumescentCableCoatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Firestop cable coatings are designed to protect cables from fire damage by either expanding and forming a char barrier (intumescent cable coatings) or resisting fire without expansion (non-intumescent cable coatings). Intumescent coatings work by swelling when exposed to heat, creating a protective barrier that insulates the cables from fire. Non-intumescent coatings, on the other hand, provide fire resistance through their inherent material properties without expanding. Both types of coatings are crucial for ensuring the safety and integrity of cables during a fire event.</p></p>
