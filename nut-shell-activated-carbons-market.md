<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nut Shell Activated Carbons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Granule</li><li>Powder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Granule activated carbons are typically used in gas phase applications such as air purification and gas phase filtration due to their larger particle size. Powdered activated carbons, on the other hand, are used in liquid phase applications like water treatment and decolorization of liquids. Both types of activated carbons have high surface areas and porous structures that make them effective in adsorbing impurities and contaminants. Granule activated carbons have better flow characteristics and are easier to handle, whereas powdered activated carbons have higher surface areas and are more efficient in liquid phase applications.</p></p>
