<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carck Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Crack Meters</li><li>Wire Crack Meters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical Crack Meters are used to measure cracks by physically observing any deformation in the meter's arms. They are suitable for monitoring small cracks in buildings or structures. On the other hand, Wire Crack Meters consist of a wire embedded within a crack, and any movement in the crack causes the wire to stretch or compress, providing precise measurements. Wire Crack Meters are typically used in larger structures or infrastructure projects where more accurate measurements are required. Both types of crack meters play a crucial role in monitoring the stability and integrity of structures.</p></p>
