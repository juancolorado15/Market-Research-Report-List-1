<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leadless Pacemaker Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Chambered Systems</li><li>Double-Chambered Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Leadless pacemaker systems refer to a type of pacemaker that does not require the use of leads, which are wires that connect the device to the heart. Single-chambered systems involve only one leadless device, while double-chambered systems involve two leadless devices working in coordination to regulate the heart's rhythm. These systems offer a more minimally invasive approach to pacing the heart, reducing the risk of complications associated with traditional pacemakers that use leads.</p></p>
