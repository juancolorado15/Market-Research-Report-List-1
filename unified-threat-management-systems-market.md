<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unified Threat Management Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-premises</li><li>Cloud Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Unified Threat Management (UTM) systems are security solutions that offer a comprehensive approach to protecting networks from various threats. UTM systems can be classified into two types: on-premises and cloud-based. On-premises UTM systems are installed and operated directly on an organization's infrastructure, providing control and security management internally. Conversely, cloud-based UTM systems are hosted and managed by a third-party provider, offering remote access and scalability. Both types aim to protect networks from threats such as malware, intrusion attempts, and data breaches, but differ in terms of location and operational management.</p></p>
