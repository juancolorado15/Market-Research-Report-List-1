<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Coal Fired Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PCC (Pulverized Coal Combustion)</li><li>Cyclone Furnace</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Coal Fired Generation refers to the process of generating electricity by burning coal. There are different types of coal-fired generation markets, namely PCC (Pulverized Coal Combustion) and Cyclone Furnace. PCC involves grinding the coal into a fine powder, which is then blown into a boiler where it burns at high temperatures. This method is widely used due to its efficiency and ability to reduce emissions. On the other hand, Cyclone Furnace involves burning coal in a cyclone chamber, where combustion occurs at a lower temperature. This method is less common and typically used for lower-quality coal.</p></p>
