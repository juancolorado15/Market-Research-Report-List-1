<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seamless Pipes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-rolled</li><li>Cold-rolled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Seamless pipes can be classified into two main types: hot-rolled and cold-rolled. Hot-rolled seamless pipes are manufactured by heating a solid billet and then shaping it into a seamless pipe through various processes. This type is known for its high strength and durability. On the other hand, cold-rolled seamless pipes are produced by rolling a pre-cut metal strip at room temperature, resulting in a smoother surface finish and tighter tolerances. Both types serve different industrial applications based on their specific characteristics and properties.</p></p>
