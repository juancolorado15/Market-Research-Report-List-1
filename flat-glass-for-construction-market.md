<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Glass for Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass Process</li><li>Float Glass Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flat glass for construction can be produced through two main processes: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is created by pouring molten glass onto a metal table and rolling it into a sheet. This process is cost-effective but produces glass with slight imperfections. Float glass, on the other hand, is made by floating molten glass on top of molten tin, resulting in smooth and high-quality glass sheets. Float glass is more commonly used in construction due to its superior quality.</p></p>
